# pattern-inspector

Python script which reads a 2D frame of any size and determines the pattern of each cluster of data in the frame, sorting it into either a single pattern, double, triple, quadruple or greater than quadruple pattern. The values within the respective pattern are summed. This code is useful for determing the pixel pattern created by photons absorbed in a pixelated detector.
